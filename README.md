## Welcome to the Nuntio User Block ðŸ‘‹

![example workflow](https://github.com/nuntiodev/nuntio-user-block/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)

Building Nuntio Blocks: secure, efficient & open-source API blocks that run on any Linux-based environment and scales
massively. Nuntio Cloud is the commercial offering of the above technologies and help companies go from idea to
production faster, without losing control over their data or services. Our goal with Nuntio Cloud is to provide social
API-blocks that are secure, easy to set up, scales worldwide and that you can move from Nuntio Cloud to your private
data center whenever you want.

## Nuntio User Block
The Nuntio User Block is a fully fledged user-management system, designed statelessly and to run in Kubernetes. It handles advanced data encryption models and features such as: normal and verfified authentication flows, creating, fetching and updating user information with custom metatadata and much more! Reach out to info@softcorp.io if you wanna give it a try.
