Building Softcorp Blocks: secure, efficient & open-source API blocks that run on any Linux-based environment and scales massively. Softcorp Cloud is the commercial offering of the above technologies and help companies go from idea to production faster, without losing control over their data or services. Our goal with Softcorp Cloud is to provide social API-blocks that are secure, easy to set up, scales worldwide and that you can move from Softcorp Cloud to your private data center whenever you want.

## Block User Service

The User Service Block is an API block written in Golang that communicates over gRPC and can be used with the standard Softcorp Block SDKs. The User Block is responsible for handling your organization's user management and authentication - in a very simple and similar solution to Firebase Authenticate.
