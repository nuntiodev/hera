Are you tired of wasting your time writing the same service over and over again?
We are, and that's why we have created Softcorp Blocks. These are modular and simple API building blocks that run in
any Linux-based environment and that you can connect to through our simple SDK.
Our blocks are simple and are meant for your applications to build upon. The blocks are all stateless, scales horizontally and comes with a large suit of tests.
Furthermore, each block automatically handles extra metadata and encryption which means you can customize them to handle almost any environment!
<br/><br/>
The User Service block is an API block written in Golang that communicates over gRPC. The user-block is responsible for handling
your organization's user management.
