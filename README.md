Building Nuntio Blocks: secure, efficient & open-source API blocks that run on any Linux-based environment and scales massively. Nuntio Cloud is the commercial offering of the above technologies and help companies go from idea to production faster, without losing control over their data or services. Our goal with Nuntio Cloud is to provide social API-blocks that are secure, easy to set up, scales worldwide and that you can move from Nuntio Cloud to your private data center whenever you want.
